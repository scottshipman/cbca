            <p style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Live Oak Park is located right next to the shore of St Joseph's Sound, which leads out to the sparkling waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
            </p>
            <p style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Also across the street from Live Oak Park is our pier, which is a favorite spot to hang out and watch sunsets.
            </p>
            <p style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Live Oak Park was once home to Faith Mission, a local orphanage, as well as the Blue Heron Hotel. Both of these facilities are no longer standing but there is a plaque in the park (below) commemorating the fact that they were once here.
