                <p class="text-center mb-3">Between historic Tarpon Springs and Ozona sits Crystal Beach, a beautiful waterfront community. Our town, which hugs the Gulf of Mexico, is quaint, quiet and close-knit. There are no mailboxes in town. Instead, there is a small Post Office, which also serves as a spot for neighbors to meet and catch up. Next to the Post Office is the Pinellas Trail, where residents bike, jog and roller blade in the morning and evening.<br></p>
